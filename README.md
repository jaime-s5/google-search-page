# Google Searchpage Clone

## Introduction

Clone of the Google.com search results page using only HTML and CSS, without external libraries.

## Project reflections

After completion of this project, I learned:

- Better understanding of CSS positioning (relative, fixed, absolute...)
- How floats work
- How to style input elements similar to those of Google (buttons, text...)

## Webpage
